# GetInspired
#### A chrome extension which shows a new quote in every 6 seconds. It's just to inspire you.

Inspiring engineering students is primarily a matter of motivation. When inspired, the students are motivated to engage with the subject and to learn.

Whether you are seeking inspiration or just looking for a pick-me-up during the day, I hope these quotes encourage and inspire your work in education. Remember, quotes are not only a powerful way to showcase how you feel, but also a way to convey a message to many.

This is an initiative by me to inspire the young developers.

Share your inspiration with friends, fellow students and co-workers!

Thank You!
